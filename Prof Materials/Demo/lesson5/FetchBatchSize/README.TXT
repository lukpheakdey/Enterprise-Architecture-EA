
Exercises fetching WITH Batch Size [can try it with EAGER or LAZY]

Batch Size Indicates the number of Collection fetches...
In this case with the N+1 there are 3 distinct Fetches - ONE per Parent...

So if we set Batch Size >= 3, there will be ONE fetch...
If it is 2 there with be 2 fetches [ 2 Lists and then 1 List]
If it is 1 there with be 3 fetches [ One for each List]
